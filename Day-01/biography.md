Hello, I'm Jeremy Chavez. My family is predominantly Mexican. We grew up in Los Angeles, CA where I have lived all my life. I came to Mac in the fall of 2012, where my class standing was a sophomore when I arrived. I am currently studying multiple areas of interest but am having trouble with schedules and prerequisites. I wish to pursue a career in some science, while at once staying tethered to the core humanities first. In this way, coming to Macalester for my liberal arts education suits me well.
